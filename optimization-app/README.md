# Optimization App

## Motivation
Optimizing trading strategies is essential for maximizing performance. NinjaTrader provides robust optimization tools, either through brute force (default) or memory-efficient genetic algorithms. However, it is often more practical to run one optimization test with a handful of parameters at a time. This reduces the strain on your hardware and helps you obtain results faster.

While NinjaTrader allows you to view optimization results, it lacks a straightforward way to sift through multiple runs, especially when you're searching for the best combination of parameters. Simply selecting the top result is not always ideal, as you may want to prioritize a high profit factor and low maximum drawdownâ€”criteria that cannot easily be filtered in NinjaTrader.

## Introducing Optimization App
This Optimization App simplifies the process by consolidating all of your exported CSV files into one file, allowing you to filter and search for the best possible parameters. For example, you can filter for parameters that yield a net profit of $20,000, a profit factor greater than 1.6, and a maximum drawdown of $1,000. NinjaTrader's native tools would only allow you to find one of these criteria at a time.

With this app, you gain more control over your optimization results, making it easier to identify the best parameters for your trading strategies.
